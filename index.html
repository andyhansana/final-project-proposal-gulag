Q1: What does your application do?

A1: Our application is a reminder web app that reminds the user how much time they have to park and the location of the userâ€™s parked car. The application will incorporate an NFC tag sticker for the user to stick to the inside of their car. The user can tap the NFC tag with their phone to run a script using Apple Shortcuts. Our web application uses a sub-application in Apple Shortcuts which will also send a POST request to our web application. The web application handles the user login credentials along with location data and processes the data into the app and sends back a response to the user. The response will notify the user when to move their car from street sweeping in the Chicagoland area, how much time they have left to move, and the location of the car itself.

Q2: What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information, and the ability to view / add to / change that information?

A2: This is different from a CRUD app because it implements an NFC tag sticker to run a script with Apple Shortcuts, and Apple Shortcuts communicates with our web application. Our web application acts as a HTTP server for Apple Shortcuts while also utilizing its own client side user login interface.

Q3: What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?

A3: Our security and privacy concerns with this application is to obtain the minimal amount of the user information necessary to get our application functioning as intended. Information such as location service to keep track of where their vehicle is parked, and user email/username and password.
